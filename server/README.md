# petshop-kotlin

This application is built to learn 
- SpringBoot, 
- Spring Security,
- Integration tests with Test Containers 
- Unit Tests.

Before running the application
- make sure that Docker is running on your machine
- run docker compose up from the terminal
- run your application

Furthermore, I build the same application in Java to learn some Java and compare it with Kotlin.

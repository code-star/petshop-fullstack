# petshop-kotlin

This application is built to learn 
SpringBoot, 
Spring Security,
Integration tests with Test Containers 
Unit Tests.

Before running the application make sure that Docker is running on your machine.
Then
run docker compose up from the terminal and run your application.

Furthermore, I build the same application in Java to learn some Java and compare it with Kotlin.
